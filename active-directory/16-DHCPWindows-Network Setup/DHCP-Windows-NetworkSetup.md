What is DHCP Reservation?
• A reservation is a specific IP address, within a scope, that is 
permanently reserved to a specific DHCP client

What are DHCP options?
• DHCP Scope options are other server/devices addresses given to clients along 
with IP Configuration.


DHCP Failover:
• DHCP failover is a new feature available from Windows Server® 2012
ensuring continuous availability of DHCP service to clients.

• With DHCP failover, two DHCP servers share DHCP scope and lease
information, enabling one server to provide DHCP leases to DHCP
clients if the other server is unavailable

• Hot stand-by mode: This mode provides redundancy for DHCP
services.

• Load balance mode: This mode allocates DHCP client leases across
two servers
