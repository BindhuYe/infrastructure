Folder Redirection:
• Redirection of folders on the local computer or on a Shared
folder.

• Folders on a server appear as if they are located on the local
drive.

• Fastens the User logon process in case if the profile is
large

Auditing:
• Audit policy configures a system to audit categories of
activities. If audit policy is not enabled, a server will not
audit those activities

• Audit events categories are as below :
  – Access to NTFS files and folders
  – Account or object changes in AD DS
  – Logon
  – Assignment of use of user rights

Group Policy preferences:
• Group Policy preferences provide better targeting, through
item-level targeting and action modes. Additionally, rich
user interfaces and standards-based XML configurations
provide you with more power and flexibility over managed
computers when you administer GPOs.
