🔹 What is VMware?
VMware is a cloud computing and virtualization platform that allows you to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server, increasing efficiency and resource utilization.

🔧 VMware Architecture
At the heart of VMware is its hypervisor technology — the engine that enables virtualization.

👨‍💻 What is a Hypervisor?
A hypervisor is software that creates and runs virtual machines.

Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal): Installed directly on physical hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi).

Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted): Runs on an existing operating system (e.g., VMware Workstation).

🧠 VMware ESXi
This is a Type 1 hypervisor that's installed directly on a server. It abstracts the hardware and allows multiple OSes to run independently on the same server.

💡 How it Works:
ESXi allocates physical resources (CPU, memory, storage) to virtual machines and isolates them for performance and security.

🖥️ vSphere Client
This is the management interface for VMware vSphere environments. It allows administrators to create, configure, and monitor VMs and ESXi hosts.

🌐 vCenter Server
A centralized platform to manage multiple ESXi hosts and VMs from a single console.

🔄 How vCenter Works:

Centralizes VM and host management

Enables automation, performance monitoring, and clustering

Integrates with features like HA, DRS, and vMotion

💾 vSAN (Virtual SAN)
VMware’s software-defined storage solution.

⚙️ How vSAN Works:

Aggregates local storage from ESXi hosts

Forms a shared datastore

Optimizes performance and redundancy

🧠 DRS (Distributed Resource Scheduler)
Automatically balances computing workloads with resource allocation based on demand.

💥 HA (High Availability)
Monitors VM and host failures — automatically restarts VMs on healthy hosts in case of failure.

🚀 vMotion
Enables live migration of running VMs from one ESXi host to another with zero downtime.

📦 Cluster
A group of ESXi hosts managed as a single resource pool. Enables DRS, HA, and vSAN.

🔄 How Cluster Works:

Shared storage & network

Automatic failover

Dynamic resource balancing

⚙️ VRA (vRealize Automation)
VMware's cloud automation tool.

🔍 How VRA Works:

Automates provisioning of VMs

Manages multi-cloud environments

Supports self-service portals and policy-based governance
